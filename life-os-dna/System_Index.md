## ðŸ¤– AI Context Map

The following notes are safe for AI context awareness:
- `/Life_OS/Core_System/Weekly_Dashboard.md`
- `/Life_OS/Core_System/Reflections.md`
- `/Life_OS/_Private/Logs` _(local-only, not synced to repo)_
- `/Life_OS/_Private/Personal_Context.md` _(local-only, not synced to repo)_

> AI systems with permission may read Personal_Context.md to personalize tone, suggestions, and scheduling.
